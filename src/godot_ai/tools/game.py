_DESCRIPTION = """\
Runtime game inspection and input simulation.

These ops target the running game process through Godot's EngineDebugger
bridge. Start the project first with project_run and poll editor_state until
game_capture_ready=true.

Ops:
  - get_scene_tree(depth=10, root_path="")
        Inspect the running scene tree. root_path accepts an absolute runtime
        path or a scene-relative path rooted at the current scene.
  - get_node_info(path, include_properties=True)
        Inspect one running node's metadata and optional property snapshot.
  - get_ui_elements(root_path="", include_hidden=False,
                    include_disabled=True, max_depth=10)
        Inspect visible runtime Control nodes for UI testing. Includes path,
        type, text where present, disabled state, and rect metadata.
  - input_key(key, pressed=True, echo=False)
        Send a key press/release to the running game.
  - input_mouse(event, position=None, button="left", pressed=True)
        Send a mouse motion or button event. event: "motion" | "button".
        position is a {x, y} object or [x, y] array; omit it to use the
        game's current cursor position. A present but malformed position is
        rejected rather than silently falling back to the cursor.
  - input_gamepad(device=0, control="button", index=0, pressed=True, value=0.0)
        Send a joypad button or axis event. control: "button" | "axis".
  - input_action(action, pressed=True, strength=1.0)
        Set a project action's pressed state directly in the running game.
  - input_sequence(steps, settle_frames=0)
        Apply a frame-timed action timeline in one call — the frame-accurate,
        multi-step form of input_action. Each step is
        {at_frame, action, pressed=True, strength=1.0}; the game applies each
        step's action on its scheduled frame, awaits settle_frames more, then
        replies once. Use this instead of separate input_action calls whenever
        timing matters (jump arcs, combos, walk-into-trigger): per-call network
        latency makes hitting a target frame impossible otherwise. Steps must
        be ordered by non-decreasing at_frame; frames (not ms) are the timing
        basis. Action-based input is focus-independent, so it works on a
        backgrounded game window. Cannot run inside batch_execute.
  - input_state(actions=None)
        Read current action pressed states. Empty actions = all project actions."""
