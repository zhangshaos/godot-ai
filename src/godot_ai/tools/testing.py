        """Run GDScript test suites inside the connected Godot editor.

        Discovers test_*.gd in res://tests/, instantiates them, and runs
        all test_* methods. Returns a compact summary by default (counts,
        suite names, duration) plus failures only. verbose=True includes
        every individual test result (each with per-test ``duration_ms``).

        The whole run has a 300s budget; the plugin aborts between tests
        shortly before it expires and returns TEST_RUN_TIMEOUT with the
        partial summary (full partials via test_manage(op="results_get")).
        Long suites are safe — the editor services the MCP transport
        between tests — but one single test blocking the main thread for
        20s+ can still drop the session. Not allowed inside batch_execute.

        The response includes ``edited_scene`` (the scene currently open in
        the editor). Many suites assume the project's main scene is open; if
        it is not and there are failures, the response also carries a
        ``scene_warning`` — open the main scene (``scene_open``) and re-run
        before treating those failures as real.

        Args:
            suite: Run only the named suite (e.g. "scene", "node", "editor").
                Empty runs all suites.
            test_name: Run only tests whose name contains this substring.
            exclude_test_name: Skip tests whose name contains this substring.
            verbose: Include every individual test result. Default False.
