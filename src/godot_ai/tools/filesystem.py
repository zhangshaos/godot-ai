_DESCRIPTION = """\
Project filesystem access via the Godot editor's EditorFileSystem.

Ops:
  • read_text(path)
        Read a text file at a ``res://`` path. Returns content, size,
        line_count.
  • write_text(path, content="")
        Create or overwrite a text file. Updates the editor filesystem
        entry for that one file (single-file update, not a full scan).
        Newly-created files include ``data.cleanup.rm`` for transient
        smoke tests; overwrite omits the field.
  • reimport(paths)
        Force-reimport the listed files via ``EditorFileSystem.update_file``.
        ``paths`` is a list of res:// paths.
        Intended for imported assets such as textures, models, and audio.
        Paths that are not imported resources (``.gd`` scripts, ``.tscn``,
        hand-written ``.tres``, or an asset the editor has not imported yet)
        report under ``skipped_non_imported`` rather than ``reimported``: their
        filesystem entry is refreshed, but no import runs, so a success there is
        not evidence that a script parsed or that diagnostics were produced. Use
        ``script_patch``/``script_create`` to save a script and receive fresh
        diagnostics, or ``scan`` for an asset awaiting its first import.
        Returns ``reimported``, ``skipped_non_imported``, ``not_found`` and their
        counts.
  • scan()
        Force a full ``EditorFileSystem.scan()`` and wait for it to settle.
        This is the headless equivalent of the editor regaining window focus:
        ``write_text``/``script_create`` register single files but do NOT
        rebuild the global ``class_name`` table, so a freshly-created
        ``class_name MyThing extends Resource`` is invisible to
        ``resource_manage``/type references until a scan runs. Call this once
        after adding ``class_name`` scripts when the editor isn't focused.
        Single-flight (awaits any in-progress scan rather than stacking another).
        Returns ``scan_completed`` and ``global_classes_registered_delta``.
  • search(name="", type="", path="", offset=0, limit=100)
        Find files by name, resource type, or path substring. At least one
        filter must be set. Paginated.
