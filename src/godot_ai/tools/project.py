_DESCRIPTION = """\
Project run/stop and project.godot settings.

Resource form: ``godot://project/info`` and ``godot://project/settings``
— prefer for active-session reads.

Ops:
  • stop()
        Stop the running project (game). Takes no params — call as
        ``project_manage(op="stop")`` or with ``params={}``. Idempotent:
        succeeds with ``was_running=false`` if the project isn't running.
        Do NOT pass extra fields like ``force`` or ``reason`` inside
        ``params`` — only the registered keys are accepted (here, none).
        For multi-editor setups, pass ``session_id`` as a sibling of
        ``op``/``params``, not inside ``params``.
  • settings_get(key)
        Read a ProjectSettings key (e.g. "application/config/name").
  • settings_set(key, value)
        Write a ProjectSettings key and persist to project.godot.

        Modes:
        - "main": Run the project's main scene (default).
        - "current": Run the currently open scene.
        - "custom": Run a specific scene (requires ``scene``).

        Idempotent: if the project is already running, returns success with

        call ``project_manage(op="stop")`` first, then ``project_run`` again.

        After Godot's synchronous play call returns (including any editor-side
        C# build/autosave work), waits briefly for the Godot AI game helper to
        check in. ``game_status.prelaunch_msec`` separates that editor-side
        launch latency from ``ready_elapsed_msec`` spent waiting for the helper.
        The response includes ``game_status``, ``helper_live``}]}
        (status == "live"), ``session_active`` (status not in {"not_live",
        "stopped"}), and any ``recent_errors`` observed during the run window.
        The top-level booleans mirror the same fields inside ``game_status``.
        ``game_status.status="not_live"`` means playback launched but the game
        did not become live before the helper-ready window elapsed;
        ``"no_helper"`` means the project has no _mcp_game_helper autoload, as
        with some headless/custom-main-loop setups (helper_live=false,
        session_active=true); ``"stopped"`` means playback stopped or never
        became active before liveness could be confirmed (helper_live=false,
        session_active=false); ``"break"`` means the game process is parked in
        a remote-debugger break — during boot this is a GDScript parse/load
        error that froze the game before the helper could register, and the
        response names the failing script when captured
        (``game_status.break`` = ``{reason, can_debug, pre_live}``). A game at
        a break cannot continue on its own: call ``project_manage(op="stop")``,
        fix the error, and relaunch. Poll ``editor_state`` to see late
        transitions.

        Args:
            mode: "main" | "current" | "custom". Default "main".
            scene: Scene path (e.g. "res://levels/level1.tscn"). Required for "custom".
            autosave: When True (default), Godot persists in-memory MCP scene
                mutations to disk before running. Pass False for smoke tests
                where MCP edits should stay in memory.
