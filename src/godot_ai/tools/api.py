_DESCRIPTION = """\
Inspect Godot API documentation-shaped metadata from the connected editor's
ClassDB: "what properties does X have", method signatures, signals, enums,
constants, defaults, and property hint strings.

Resource form (prefer for active-session reads):
  godot://class/{class_name}

Ops:
  - get_class(class_name, sections=None, include_inherited=False,
              include_inheritors=False, offset=0, limit=100)
        Return selected class-reference sections without creating a scene
        instance. sections may be a comma-separated string or list containing
        properties, methods, signals, enums, constants, inheritors.
        Defaults to ["properties"] only — a bare get_class answers "what
        properties does X have" without the multi-thousand-token full dump.
        Pass the sections you want by name, or "all" for the full set
        (properties, methods, signals, enums, constants). "all" does NOT
        include the heavier "inheritors" section — request that by name.
        For pagination, request one section at a time so offset/limit apply
        only to the list you are paging.
