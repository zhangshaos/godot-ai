Signals (Godot's event/observer mechanism) — list, connect, disconnect.

Ops:
  • list(path, include_editor=False)
        List all signals on the node and their current connections (built-in
        and custom). By default editor-internal connections (the
        SceneTreeEditor dock and friends) are filtered out — pass
        ``include_editor=True`` to surface them. The response carries
        ``editor_connection_count`` so an agent can tell how many were hidden.
  • connect(path, signal, target, method)
        Connect a signal from ``path`` to a method on the target node.
        Undoable.
  • disconnect(path, signal, target, method)
        Remove an existing connection. Undoable.
