Editor selection, performance monitors, quit, log clearing, game eval.

Resource forms (prefer for active-session reads):
  godot://editor/state, godot://selection/current, godot://performance

Ops:
  • health()
        Compact backend and active/pinned Editor connectivity/readiness from
        server-side session cache. Never performs a live Editor round-trip, so
        it stays usable while the Godot main thread is blocked or reconnecting.
        Use state() afterward when a live Editor probe is required.
  • state()
        Editor version, project name, current scene, readiness, play state.
  • selection_get()
        Currently selected node paths in the editor.
  • selection_set(paths)
        Replace the selection with the given list of scene paths.
  • monitors_get(monitors=None)
        Performance singleton values (FPS, memory, draw calls, etc.). Pass
        a list of monitor names to filter; None returns everything.
  • quit()
        Gracefully quit the Godot editor on next frame.
  • logs_clear(clear_debugger_errors=False)
        Clear the MCP log buffer. Returns cleared_count. Pass
        clear_debugger_errors=True to also clear the Debugger dock's
        visible Errors-tab rows (user-facing UI, so opt-in only); the
        response then includes debugger_errors_cleared.
  • game_eval(code)
        Execute GDScript in the running game with return values. Uses
        'await' so user code can await internally. Errors return fast and
        actionable: EVAL_COMPILE_ERROR for a syntax/parse error,
        EVAL_RUNTIME_ERROR (with the real message + line) for a runtime
        error; EVAL_GAME_NOT_READY if the game can't service evals — still
        launching (retry once it's up), the _mcp_game_helper autoload is
        missing/disabled, or the game is parked in a debugger break (stop
        and relaunch); EVAL_HUNG for a genuine infinite loop / never-firing
        await; EVAL_RESULT_TOO_LARGE if the returned value serializes past
        the debugger channel's capacity (return a smaller slice). 'await'
        only progresses while the game window is focused."""

        rejected as ``EDITOR_NOT_READY (state=playing)`` when you already know
        the game has stopped — calling ``editor_state`` once syncs the cache

        - "plugin" (default): MCP plugin recv/send/event traffic. Buffer 500.
        - "game": stdout/stderr/push_error/push_warning from playing game
          via ``_mcp_game_helper`` autoload (Godot 4.5+). Buffer 2000, with
          lines retained across runs and tagged by run_id. Default reads return
          current-run lines only; pass ``since_run_id`` from an earlier response
          to read that prior run. Entries: {source, level, text, run_id};
          response carries run_id, current_run_id, game_status, helper_live,
          session_active, dropped_count, stale_run_id. helper_live and
          session_active mirror the same fields inside game_status; is_running
          is retained as a compatibility alias of session_active.
          Boot-time parse/load errors fire before the game helper's logger
          attaches, so they are NEVER in this buffer; when editor-side errors
          were recorded during the current run the response adds
          ``editor_errors_count`` and ``editor_errors_hint`` pointing at
          source="editor" — treat a clean game log carrying that hint as a
          run that lost scripts, not a clean launch.
        - "editor": editor-process script errors and the Debugger dock's
          visible Errors-tab rows — parse errors, GDScript reload warnings,
          @tool/EditorPlugin runtime errors, push_error/push_warning.
          Logger-backed entries require Godot 4.5+; Errors-tab rows are read
          from the editor UI when available. Use when the editor Output or
          Debugger Errors panel shows red/yellow rows but other sources turned
          up nothing. Buffer 500 for logger-backed entries; Debugger rows are
          live UI state. Entries: {source, level, text, path, line, function}.
          Filtered to .gd/.cs in the user project for Logger-backed entries;
          addons/godot_ai/ dropped. Logger entries fired before plugin enable
          are not captured.
        - "all": plugin → editor → game lines (with source per entry).

        Tail pattern: for game logs, poll the current run with offset=N and
        keep the returned run_id. ``current_run_id`` identifies the active run;
        ``run_id`` identifies the run being read. Passing
        ``since_run_id=old_run_id`` reads retained lines for that prior run, and
        ``stale_run_id: true`` means the requested run is not the current run.
        For editor logs, read once to capture
        ``next_cursor`` and pass it back as ``since_cursor`` on later calls.
        ``since_cursor`` reads Logger-backed editor entries only; live Debugger
        Errors-tab rows are included in regular source="editor" reads but do
        not have stable cursors. When ``since_cursor`` is set, it supersedes
        ``offset``. ``truncated: true`` means older entries fell out of the
        ring before the poll; continue from the returned ``next_cursor`` and
        treat ``oldest_cursor`` as the earliest retained sequence.
        Set ``include_details=True`` for Errors-tab style metadata on game/editor
        entries: original code/rationale, error type, resolved source, and
        stack frames. Default false preserves compact responses.

        Args:
            count: Max lines to return. Default 50.
            offset: Lines to skip. Default 0.

                retained run instead of the current run.
            since_cursor: Editor-log cursor from a previous source="editor" response.
            include_details: Include rich error metadata for game/editor entries.

        Picking a source: the default ``"viewport"`` captures the editor's 3D

            no-3D-content / no-scene error shape.
        - "viewport_2d": editor 2D viewport. Use for 2D scenes.
            Not compatible with view_target/coverage/elevation/azimuth/fov.
        - "cinematic": render edited scene through its active Camera3D (no

        - "game": running game's framebuffer (only when project is running).
          A backgrounded/minimized game window freezes its main loop; the

          game window and retry for a current frame. ``GAME_HELPER_TIMEOUT``
          means the game process never replied at all (nothing rendered yet,
          main thread blocked, or helper dead) — focus the window and retry,
          or use game_command to confirm liveness.

        ``include_image=True`` (default) returns an MCP ImageContent block.
        ``view_target`` (comma-separated Node3D paths) reframes editor camera;

        captures perspective + orthographic top-down references.
