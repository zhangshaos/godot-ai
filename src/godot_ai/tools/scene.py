Scene authoring (create, save_as, list open roots).

Resource form: ``godot://scene/current`` and ``godot://scene/hierarchy``
— prefer for active-session reads.

Ops:
  • create(path, root_type="Node3D", root_name="")
        Create a new .tscn with the given root and open it. root_name
        defaults to filename basename when empty.
  • save_as(path)
        Save the currently edited scene to a new file path.
  • get_roots()
        List scenes currently open in the editor; flag the edited one.

        ``switched: false`` and ``settle: "not_waited"``. In both of those
        cases, re-check ``editor_state`` before issuing follow-up writes.
