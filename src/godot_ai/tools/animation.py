Everything else (player creation, tracks, autoplay, presets, playback,
introspection) collapses into ``animation_manage``.

_DESCRIPTION = """\
AnimationPlayer authoring (player, tracks, autoplay, presets, playback).

Ops:
  • player_create(parent_path, name="AnimationPlayer")
        Create an AnimationPlayer with empty default library.
  • delete(player_path, animation_name)
        Delete an animation clip from the default library. Undoable.
  • validate(player_path, animation_name)
        Check all track paths resolve. Returns broken_count + per-track issues.
  • add_property_track(player_path, animation_name, track_path, keyframes,
                        interpolation="linear")
        Add a property track. track_path: "NodeName:property". keyframes:
        [{time, value, transition?}, ...]. interpolation: linear|nearest|cubic.
  • add_method_track(player_path, animation_name, target_node_path, keyframes)
        Add a method track. keyframes: [{time, method, args?}, ...].
  • set_autoplay(player_path, animation_name="")
        Set autoplay. Empty animation_name clears.
  • play(player_path, animation_name="")
        Editor preview. Not saved with scene.
  • stop(player_path)
        Stop editor preview. Not saved with scene.
  • list(player_path)
        List animations with length, loop_mode, track_count.
  • get(player_path, animation_name)
        Inspect a clip's tracks and keyframes in detail.
  • create_simple(player_path, name, tweens, length=None, loop_mode="none",
                   overwrite=False)
        High-level: build a multi-track clip from tween specs in one call.
        tweens: [{target, property, from, to, duration, delay?, transition?}].
  • preset_fade(player_path, target_path, mode="in", duration=0.5,
                 animation_name="", overwrite=False)
        One-call fade-in/out (modulate.a).
  • preset_slide(player_path, target_path, direction="left", mode="in",
                  distance=None, duration=0.4, animation_name="", overwrite=False)
        One-call slide-in/out (position).
  • preset_shake(player_path, target_path, intensity=None, duration=0.3,
                  frequency=30.0, seed=0, animation_name="", overwrite=False)
        One-call shake (jittered position).
  • preset_pulse(player_path, target_path, from_scale=1.0, to_scale=1.1,
                  duration=0.4, animation_name="", overwrite=False)
        One-call pulse / hover-bounce (3-keyframe scale ping-pong).

Preset target_path: accepts either a scene-absolute path (e.g. "/Main/World/Cube",
matching every other scene tool) or a path relative to the AnimationPlayer's
root_node (e.g. "World/Cube", matching how Animation tracks store node paths).
Scene-absolute targets outside the player's root_node subtree are converted to
a `..`-prefixed track path via root_node.get_path_to(target), the same shape
the relative form already accepts.
