class EditorNotReadySubCode(StrEnum):
    """#651 stage 1: sub-codes carried in ``error.data.sub_code`` on
    EDITOR_NOT_READY errors.

    Never emitted as a top-level ``error.code`` — existing callers and
    dashboards key on EDITOR_NOT_READY, so the top-level code is frozen.
    Each value names the concrete editor state at rejection time, limited
    to what EditorInterface/EditorFileSystem report deterministically.
    Undetectable busy states (script compilation, resource reload, modal
    dialogs) intentionally have no sub-code — a bare EDITOR_NOT_READY with
    no ``data.sub_code`` is the honest fallback, not a guessed label.
    Keep in sync with utils/error_codes.gd ``SUB_*`` constants — enforced
    by tests/unit/test_editor_not_ready_hint_contract.py.
