# Available Tools

Godot AI exposes ~43 MCP tools — 19 high-traffic verbs as named tools, plus
one rolled-up `<domain>_manage` per domain that takes `op="..."` + a `params`
dict. The rollup pattern keeps the tool count well below the 100-tool caps
some clients enforce while still exposing every action.

The plugin command surface (over WebSocket) is unchanged; only the MCP tool
names move. Inside `batch_execute`'s `commands[].command` field, keep using
the underlying plugin command names (e.g. `create_node`, `set_property`),
not the MCP tool names.

## Always-loaded core tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `editor_state` | Editor version, project name, current scene, readiness, play state, and game liveness status |
| `scene_get_hierarchy` | Paginated scene tree walk (depth, offset, limit) |
| `node_get_properties` | Full property snapshot of a node |
| `session_activate` | Pin subsequent calls to a specific connected editor |

## Top-level deferred verbs (high-traffic write/read)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `batch_execute` | Run multiple plugin commands atomically (rollback on first error) |
| `node_create` / `node_set_property` / `node_find` | Common node writes + search |
| `scene_open` / `scene_save` | Open and save scenes |
| `script_create` / `script_attach` / `script_patch` | Create, attach, anchor-edit GDScript files |
| `project_run` | Play the project, then wait briefly for game liveness (autosave persists in-memory MCP edits unless `autosave=False`) |
| `test_run` | Run GDScript test suites in the editor — see [testing.md](testing.md) for writing suites and the `McpTestSuite` API |
| `logs_read` | Read plugin / game / editor / combined log buffers. `source="editor"` surfaces parse errors, GDScript reload warnings, @tool/EditorPlugin runtime errors, push_error/push_warning, and visible Debugger dock Errors-tab rows — use this when the editor's Output or Debugger Errors panel shows red/yellow rows |
| `editor_screenshot` | Capture the editor 3D viewport (`viewport`), editor 2D viewport (`viewport_2d`), cinematic Camera3D render (`cinematic`), or running game framebuffer (`game`). With Vision Routing enabled, images are replaced by a text description (`vision_description` / `routed_via`) - see [vision-routing.md](vision-routing.md) |
| `editor_reload_plugin` | Reload the plugin and wait for reconnect (works with external and plugin-managed servers) |
| `animation_create` | Create an Animation clip (auto-creates AnimationPlayer + library if missing) |

`logs_read` also accepts `include_details=true` for `source="editor"`,
`source="game"`, and `source="all"`. Detailed entries include the original
Godot `_log_error` code/rationale when available, error type, resolved source
location, and stack/error-tree context corresponding to the Debugger dock's
Errors tab.

`project_run` starts playback and waits briefly for the running game to become
live through `_mcp_game_helper`. Its response includes `game_status`,
`helper_live`, `session_active`, and any `recent_errors` found while waiting.
The booleans are derived once inside `game_status` and mirrored at the top
level for convenience.
`game_status.status="live"` means the helper checked in. `"not_live"` means the
game launched but did not become live before the helper-ready window elapsed;
if a run-scoped parse/load error appeared, the response names it and points to
`logs_read(source="editor", include_details=true)`. `"no_helper"` means the
game launched but this project has no `_mcp_game_helper` autoload, as with some
headless/custom-main-loop setups: `helper_live=false` while
`session_active=true`. `"launching"` is a soft "not live yet" state and can
reconcile on a later `editor_state` poll. `"break"` means the game process is
parked in a remote-debugger break: during boot this is a GDScript parse/load
error (`GDScriptLanguage::debug_break_parse`) that freezes the game before the
helper can register and before any error record reaches the Errors tab, the
editor Logger, or the game log (#645). The plugin synthesizes an error record
from the debugger break (reason + Stack Trace frames) so the `project_run`
response names the failing script, and `game_status.break` carries `{reason,
can_debug, pre_live}`. The run cannot continue on its own — call
`project_manage(op="stop")`, fix the error, and relaunch. `helper_live=false`,
`session_active=true` while at a break.

`editor_state` includes the same `game_status` object in addition to the legacy
`is_playing` boolean and `game_capture_ready`. It also mirrors
`game_status.helper_live` (`game_status.status=="live"`) and
`game_status.session_active` (`game_status.status` is not `"not_live"` or
`"stopped"`). `is_playing` remains raw editor play-state for compatibility; use
`game_status.status` for liveness decisions.

For game logs, `logs_read(source="game")` returns lines from the current game
run only. Each play-start creates a new `run_id`, even if the game never reaches
the `_mcp_game_helper` hello beacon; prior run lines stay retained but do not
appear in the default response. To retrieve a prior run, keep the `run_id` from
an earlier response and pass `logs_read(source="game", since_run_id="...")`;
the response includes both `run_id` (the run being read) and `current_run_id`
(the latest run). `stale_run_id=true` means the requested run is not the current
one. There is no single `source="game"` call that returns every retained game
line across all runs; consumers that need history should retain run ids and
query each run explicitly.

Boot-time parse/load errors happen while autoload scripts compile — before the
game helper's logger attaches — so they can never appear in `source="game"`.
When editor-side errors were recorded during the current run, the game-scope
response adds `editor_errors_count` and `editor_errors_hint` pointing at
`logs_read(source="editor", include_details=true)`; a clean game log carrying
that hint means the run lost scripts, not that the launch was clean (#641).

Game and combined log responses also include `game_status`, `helper_live`, and
`session_active`; the top-level booleans mirror `game_status.helper_live` and
`game_status.session_active`. For compatibility, `is_running` is retained as an
alias of `session_active`; it is no longer raw editor play-state. Both are `false` for
`game_status.status` of `"not_live"` or `"stopped"`, and `true` for `"live"`,
`"launching"`, `"break"`, or `"no_helper"`. This lets a parse/load failure that leaves the
editor play button active report as not running, while a legitimate headless or
custom-main-loop project without `_mcp_game_helper` remains active with
`helper_live=false`, `session_active=true`, and
`game_status.status="no_helper"`.

For incremental editor-log polling, call `logs_read(source="editor")` once and
save the returned `next_cursor`; later calls can pass
`logs_read(source="editor", since_cursor=N)` to receive only Logger-backed
editor entries appended after that cursor. Cursor responses include
`cursor`, `oldest_cursor`, `next_cursor`, `appended_total`, `truncated`, and
`has_more`; `since_cursor` supersedes `offset`. If `truncated=true`, the
caller fell behind the ring and some entries were evicted before the poll —
continue from the returned `next_cursor` and treat `oldest_cursor` as the
earliest retained sequence. If the plugin reloads, a stale high cursor
self-heals to the new tail with an empty response and a corrected
`next_cursor`. Live Debugger dock Errors-tab rows are merged into regular
`source="editor"` reads, but they are UI state rather than ring-buffer entries
and are not included in `since_cursor` responses.

`editor_manage(op="logs_clear")` accepts `clear_debugger_errors=true` to also
clear the Debugger dock's visible Errors-tab rows (routed through the panel's
own Clear path so the tab badge and counters reset). The Errors panel is
user-facing UI, so the default leaves it untouched.

When new GDScript errors or warnings are observed since a client's previous
call — from the editor logger, the game log buffer, or Debugger Errors-tab
rows promoted by the run/stop deferred scans (#641) — the next tool response
carries `new_errors_since_last_call` / `new_warnings_since_last_call` (int)
and the corresponding `new_errors_hint` / `new_warnings_hint`. The hint is
conditional: if the client is partway through a planned multi-file scaffold,
it should finish the related writes and run `filesystem_manage(op="scan")`
before debugging; otherwise it should inspect
`logs_read(source="editor"|"game", include_details=true)`.

The count represents newly observed diagnostic entries after limited
cross-source overlap handling. It is not a count of affected files or distinct
logical error conditions. A single parse failure may contribute multiple
root-error and derived-wrapper entries. Treat the value as a doorbell, not as
a precise issue count, and inspect the diagnostics/logs for details. The
overlap handling covers cross-source views of the same event: a running game's
script error reaches the server through both the game log buffer and the
Errors tab, and those overlapping views are deduplicated rather than summed.
Error and warning stamps are independent. Each stamp is delivered exactly once
and consumed by that delivery — do not poll for it to repeat. It can appear on
any tool's response, including `logs_read` itself.

Headless sessions: a parse failure in a `.gd` file written through MCP
(`script_create`, `script_patch`, `filesystem_manage(op="write_text")`) is
surfaced through the write response's `diagnostics` field and may never
increment `new_errors_since_last_call` — even after a settled
`filesystem_manage(op="scan")`. Per-write validation runs against a private
capture buffer kept out of the shared editor log, and a scan does not reload
an unchanged already-registered broken file, so no editor-origin parse event
enters the ring. Headless agents and CI harnesses must inspect each write
response's `diagnostics` — that is the contract-guaranteed channel for
MCP-written code (#766).

Set `GODOT_AI_SUPPRESS_DIAGNOSTIC_HINTS=true` (or `1`) before starting the
server to consume these diagnostic stamps without adding their counts or hints
to tool responses. Suppression covers both errors and warnings and discards
real diagnostic hints too; changing it requires a server restart. This is an
escape hatch, not a rollback switch for later scaffold-aware classification or
settlement stages.

`script_create` and `script_patch` validate written `.gd` content before the
editor import step and include per-write diagnostics in their response:
`diagnostics` (array of structured editor-style entries), `diagnostics_scope`
(`"this_file"`), `diagnostics_status` (`"checked"` or `"partial"` if the scoped
validation log window overflowed), and `diagnostics_detail`.
`diagnostics_detail` is `"log_capture"` when Godot's Logger API supplied
real parse diagnostics for the written file, `"fallback"` when validation failed
but Logger details were unavailable, and `"none"`
when no diagnostics were reported. Fallback diagnostics still prove the content
failed validation, but their line number is a best-effort hint marked with
`details.fallback_line`. In headless sessions this per-write `diagnostics`
field is the reliable error channel for MCP-written code: the parse failure
may never ring the `new_errors_since_last_call` doorbell (see "Headless
sessions" above, #766).

## Domain rollups (`<domain>_manage`)

Each rollup is a single MCP tool dispatched by `op` name + `params` dict.
The `op` field is a `Literal[...]` enum so MCP clients with schema-aware
autocomplete still see every valid verb. Unknown ops surface a structured
error with fuzzy `data.suggestions`.

The nested form is canonical. For compatibility, the server also accepts
op-specific parameters beside `op` and folds them into `params` when the client
transmits those extra fields. `op` and `session_id` always remain top-level.

Calls take the form:

```json
{"op": "set_color", "params": {"theme_path": "res://theme.tres",
                                "class_name": "Label", "name": "font_color",
                                "value": "#ff0000"}}
```

`filesystem_manage.reimport` is intended for imported assets such as textures,
models, and audio. Godot scripts (`.gd`) are not imported resources: a successful
`.gd` entry only refreshes its editor filesystem cache entry and does not prove the
script was parsed or diagnostics were produced. Use `script_patch` or
`script_create` to save scripts and receive fresh diagnostics.

`api_manage(op="get_class")` inspects Godot API/ClassDB metadata for a class
without creating an instance. By default it returns **only `properties`**
(direct members, capped at 100 items) — a bare `get_class` is almost always
"what properties does X have", and the full section dump costs an agent
thousands of tokens it rarely wanted. Pass `sections` to widen it
(`properties`, `methods`, `signals`, `enums`, `constants`, `inheritors`), or
`sections="all"` for the full documentation set (all of those **except**
`inheritors`, which stays opt-in by name). `include_inherited=true`,
`include_inheritors=true`, `offset`, and `limit=0` further shape the result.
When paginating, request one section at a time so `offset`/`limit` apply only
to the list you are paging. The `godot://class/{class_name}` resource form
cannot take `sections`, so it always returns the full set.

`game_manage(op="input_sequence")` drives a **frame-timed** action timeline in
the running game in a single call — the frame-accurate, multi-step form of
`input_action`. Reach for it whenever timing matters (jump arcs, combos,
"walk into the trigger then assert"): expressing the same thing as separate
`input_action` calls fails because each call lands on whichever frame its
network round-trip happens to complete on, so the timing drifts and the run
isn't reproducible. The game applies each step's action on its scheduled frame,
awaits `settle_frames` more, then replies once.

Each step is `{at_frame, action, pressed=True, strength=1.0}`. Steps must be
ordered by non-decreasing `at_frame`; two steps sharing a frame is a valid
combo. Frames (not milliseconds) are the timing basis — that's what reproduces
identically across runs. Action-based input is focus-independent, so a sequence
works even against a backgrounded game window. A sequence is bounded (step and
frame caps) and cannot be nested inside `batch_execute` (its reply is deferred
and a batch has no completion channel for it).

Worked example — a jump arc (hold jump 6 frames, run right for 24, then let
1 frame settle before reading the landing):

```json
{
  "op": "input_sequence",
  "params": {
    "steps": [
      {"at_frame": 0,  "action": "jump",       "pressed": true},
      {"at_frame": 6,  "action": "jump",       "pressed": false},
      {"at_frame": 6,  "action": "move_right", "pressed": true},
      {"at_frame": 30, "action": "move_right", "pressed": false}
    ],
    "settle_frames": 1
  }
}
```

The reply reports `completed`, `steps_applied`, `frames_elapsed`, an `applied`
array (each step's `at_frame`/`action`/`pressed`), and `actions_pressed_at_end`
— the last so you know which actions are still held (a press with no matching
release stays down) and must be released before the next check. Follow with `get_node_info` / `get_scene_tree` to assert the
resulting world state.

Every rolled-up tool also accepts an optional top-level `session_id` for
per-call multi-editor routing (sibling of `op` and `params`, *not* nested
inside `params`).

## MCP Resources

Read-only URIs served alongside the tool surface. They don't count against
tool caps and are preferred for active-session reads when the client
surfaces them. The matching tool form is the fallback for clients that
don't, and the only path that supports `session_id` pinning.
