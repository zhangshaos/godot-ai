# AGENTS.md - Godot AI

This guide is for any AI assistant working in this repository. Keep Claude-specific files such as `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/skills/*` as thin pointers to this shared guidance.

## What this project is

A production-grade MCP server for Godot. Python server (FastMCP v3) communicates over WebSocket with a GDScript editor plugin. AI clients call MCP tools → Python routes commands → Godot plugin executes against the editor API → results flow back.

## Architecture

- **Protocol**: JSON over WebSocket. Request/response with `request_id` correlation. Handshake on connect.
- **WS trust boundary**: the editor↔server WebSocket (port 9500) is **effectively unauthenticated**; loopback-only binding is the whole boundary. Never bind it beyond loopback, and never add plugin-side logic that assumes the peer on 9500 is trusted. The handshake token is hardening, not authentication. Full contract, including the deliberately-accepted downgrades: [docs/plugin-architecture.md](docs/plugin-architecture.md#security-model).
- **Session model**: Multiple Godot editors can connect. Tools route through active session.
- **Handler/Runtime layer**: Shared handlers in `src/godot_ai/handlers/` contain tool logic. They depend on `DirectRuntime`, the in-process runtime adapter. Tools and resources are thin wrappers that create a runtime and delegate.
- **Readiness gating**: writes check session readiness before executing — Python write handlers must `await require_writable_async()` (`handlers/_readiness.py`), and every new plugin response builder must stamp the envelope-level `readiness` field. `EDITOR_NOT_READY` is frozen as a top-level code; never promote a `data.sub_code` into `error.code`. Self-healing, the importing-hold, and the sub-code vocabulary: [docs/plugin-architecture.md](docs/plugin-architecture.md#session-and-readiness-model).

## Project structure

Read the tree directly — `src/godot_ai/` (Python MCP server) and
`plugin/addons/godot_ai/` (GDScript editor plugin) are the two roots, and the
directory names say what they hold. The parts the layout does *not* tell you:

- `plugin/addons/godot_ai/` is the canonical GDScript copy. `test_project/addons/godot_ai`
  is a locally-built symlink (Windows junction) into it, not tracked in git.
- `src/godot_ai/tools/_meta_tool.py` holds `register_manage_tool`, the rollup factory.
- `src/godot_ai/middleware/` registration order is load-bearing — see "Key conventions".
- `script/` ships fixers for dev-environment problems; scan it before doing setup by hand.

## Key conventions

- **GDScript plugin is the canonical copy** in `plugin/`. `test_project/addons/godot_ai` is a locally-built symlink (or Windows junction) into `plugin/addons/godot_ai` — not tracked in git, created by `script/setup-dev` / `script/verify-worktree`.
- **Error codes**: Defined in `protocol/errors.py` (Python) and `utils/error_codes.gd` (GDScript). Keep in sync. Use Godot's built-in `error_string(err)` to translate numeric error codes in error messages — do not write a custom lookup table.
- **Tools return `dict`**: Handlers call `runtime.send_command(command, params)` which returns a dict or raises. Tools create a `DirectRuntime` and delegate to handlers.
- **Plugin runs on main thread**: All GDScript executes in `_process()` with a 4ms frame budget. Never block. Use `call_deferred` for scene tree mutations.
- **Scene paths are clean**: `/Main/Camera3D` format, not raw Godot internal paths. Use `McpScenePath.from_node(node, scene_root)` in GDScript.
- **Class naming**: classes that need a project-wide `class_name` (i.e. used as a type annotation across multiple files) carry the `Mcp*` prefix to avoid colliding with user-project classes. Internals only used inside the plugin (handlers, presets/values, test stubs) skip `class_name` entirely and load via `const X := preload("res://addons/godot_ai/...")` from their consumers — except handlers, which `plugin.gd` deliberately does NOT preload: they register by script path via `McpDispatcher.register_lazy_handler` / `register_lazy` and are `load()`ed at first dispatch, keeping the boot-time compile closure small (#736). Do not add a bare-name `class_name` for a new class — pick `Mcp*` or `preload`. The choice of `Mcp*` vs preload-only is stylistic, not a parse-safety measure; the #398 self-update parse-error class is fixed at the runner by writing one consistent snapshot before scan, and both forms are parse-safe across upgrades from the fixed release onward.
- **Never delete a published `class_name` declaration**: removing `class_name X` from a class that was registered in any prior released version can trigger a "Could not resolve script" cascade during the self-update disable -> extract -> enable window. This is independent of the runner's single-phase install ordering. If a class_name must be retired, leave the original file path and `class_name` in place as a compatibility shim.
- **MCP logging**: Plugin prints `MCP | [recv] command(params)` / `MCP | [send] command -> ok` to Godot console. Controlled by the dock's "Log" toggle, persisted via EditorSetting `godot_ai/mcp_logging` (routes to the dispatcher `mcp_logging` var and `McpLogBuffer.enabled` console echo). High-frequency `[event] readiness -> ...` lines record to the ring buffer only (`log(msg, echo=false)`) and never echo to the console (#626).
- **Tool surface — ~18 named verbs + per-domain `<domain>_manage` rollups**: each domain exposes one rolled-up tool taking `op="<verb>"` + a `params` dict, alongside high-traffic verbs as named tools, so clients that ignore `defer_loading` stay under their tool-count caps. Core tools (`editor_state`, `scene_get_hierarchy`, `node_get_properties`, `session_activate`) stay non-deferred; everything else is tagged `meta={"defer_loading": True}`. When adding a verb, prefer an op on the existing `register_manage_tool(...)` call over a new top-level tool. Rationale and the full checklist: [docs/tool-surface.md](docs/tool-surface.md); op map: `docs/TOOLS.md`.
- **Tool resources alongside tools**: Read-only `godot://...` URIs mirror the most-used reads (`godot://node/{path}/properties`, `godot://script/{path}`, `godot://materials`, …). Resources don't count against tool caps; tool forms are the fallback for clients that don't surface resources, and the only path that supports per-call `session_id` pinning. When a tool has a resource counterpart, its description appends `Resource form: godot://...` so aware clients can route the cheap reads through the URI.
- **`batch_execute` uses plugin command names, not MCP tool names**: the MCP tool `node_create` dispatches the plugin command `create_node`. Inside `batch_execute`'s `commands[].command` field — and inside a `<domain>_manage` op — use the plugin name. The Python handlers in `src/godot_ai/handlers/` are the authoritative map: each calls `runtime.send_command("<plugin_cmd>", ...)`. [docs/tool-surface.md](docs/tool-surface.md)
- **Session IDs**: format is `<project-slug>@<4hex>` (e.g. `godot-ai@a3f2`). The slug is derived from the project directory name so agents can recognize which editor they're targeting; the hex suffix disambiguates same-project twins. Server treats the ID as an opaque key.
- **Per-call session routing**: every Godot-talking tool accepts an optional `session_id` parameter. Empty (the default) resolves to the global active session. When supplied, that single call targets that session — `require_writable` and every handler inside the call see the pinned session, not the active one. Use this when multiple AI clients share one MCP server. For `<domain>_manage` rollups, `session_id` is a sibling of `op` and `params` (top-level), *not* nested inside `params`. Resources (`godot://...`) still resolve via the active session.
- **FastMCP middleware order is load-bearing**: `src/godot_ai/server.py` registers, in this order, `PreserveGodotCommandErrorData → StripClientWrapperKwargs → ParseStringifiedParams → FoldFlatManageParams → HintOpTypoOnManage`. FastMCP composes the chain via `reversed(self.middleware)`, so first-added is **outermost** (sees response last) and last-added is **innermost** (sees response first). The five positions are reasoned out in the docstring above the `mcp.add_middleware(...)` calls in `server.py`; the order is locked by `tests/unit/test_server_middleware_order.py`. Adding new middleware: read that docstring, decide the position, update both the docstring and the test in lockstep.
- **Telemetry is wrap-once at server build time**: `src/godot_ai/server.py` calls `install_fastmcp_wraps(mcp)` right after constructing the FastMCP instance and before any `register_<domain>_tools(mcp)`. That call replaces `mcp.tool` / `mcp.resource` with auto-instrumenting versions, so every tool and resource (including the `<domain>_manage` rollups, whose `op` arg is captured as `sub_action`) gets one `tool_execution` / `resource_retrieval` record per call automatically. Adding a new tool, resource, or rollup op needs **no telemetry call**. Opt-out is `GODOT_AI_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true` (also accepts `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true`). The endpoint is configured via `GODOT_AI_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT`; if unset, a baked-in production default endpoint is used, so telemetry sends by default — the only way to prevent sends is the opt-out env var. Session-id slugs are sha256-hashed before leaving the process so project directory names don't leak. Plugin-side events (dock startup, self-update outcome) ride the existing `send_event("plugin_event", …)` channel; the names allowlist lives in both `plugin/addons/godot_ai/telemetry.gd` and `src/godot_ai/transport/websocket.py::_PLUGIN_EVENT_NAMES` — keep them in sync. Full reference: `docs/TELEMETRY.md`.
- **Client auto-configuration**: the plugin configures 22 MCP clients from a registry of
  data-only descriptors; adding one is a new `clients/<name>.gd` plus one `preload` in
  `_registry.gd`, with no strategy edits. All descriptors are command-shape (`godot-ai
  attach` stdio entries) except cherry_studio, which stays URL-mode by design.

### Published `class_name` compatibility

Treat a shipped `class_name` as compatibility surface for self-update. v2.4.0 -> v2.4.1 reproduced a 500+ error cascade when `class_name McpErrorCodes` was dropped; v2.4.2 restored it. Single-phase install fixes mixed-snapshot parse errors, but it does not make deleting a previously registered class safe.

If a `class_name` needs to become a shim, keep the original file path and declaration:

- Inheritance-shaped classes can usually `extends "res://addons/godot_ai/.../impl_file.gd"`.
- Static-constants/static-method classes need explicit forwarding or duplicated constants; `extends` does not surface static members through class-name lookup.
- Mixed classes should either keep the implementation in the original file or hand-write a shim that preserves every published static and instance shape.

Practical rule: keeping the implementation in the original class_name file is usually simpler and safer than retiring it. If a class truly becomes obsolete, leave a no-op `class_name` stub in place so older projects can pass through the self-update window cleanly.

## Worktrees

Assistant sessions may run in git worktrees. Claude Code commonly uses `.claude/worktrees/<name>/`. Be aware of which worktree you're in — it affects everything:

- **File paths**: Your working directory is the worktree, not the repo root. Files you create live in that worktree.
- **Godot editor**: The editor runs against a specific worktree's `test_project/`. The plugin is symlinked from that worktree's `plugin/` directory. Check `session_list` — the `project_path` field tells you which worktree the editor is using.
- **Dev server**: The plugin-managed server (auto-spawned on editor start, no `--reload`) uses the root repo's `.venv` and `src/`. Python code changes in a worktree won't take effect there unless the root repo also has them. Two ways to serve the worktree's own Python source: (a) click **Start Dev Server** in the dock — it walks up from `res://` to find a sibling `src/godot_ai/` and auto-sets `PYTHONPATH` to that tree's `src/` before spawning `--reload`; (b) run `script/serve-this-worktree` from a terminal for the same effect outside the editor.
- **Passing info between sessions**: When writing prompts, handoff notes, or file references intended for another session, **always include the full worktree path** or specify the worktree name. Relative paths like `docs/friction-log.md` are ambiguous — a different session may be in a different worktree or on `main`. Use the absolute path.
- **Merging**: Worktree branches must be merged to `main` and pulled into other worktrees for changes to propagate. The plugin symlink means GDScript changes propagate within the same worktree immediately, but not across worktrees.

Repairing a broken worktree (`script/verify-worktree`, the `post-checkout` hook) and
coexisting with another session's in-flight work: [docs/worktrees.md](docs/worktrees.md).

### Godot editor + worktree safety

**Never launch Godot at *another session's* worktree.** Worktrees can be auto-removed when their owning assistant session exits — MCP tools write files to whatever `test_project/` the editor is running, so all uncommitted scene files, scripts, and themes inside a vanished worktree are permanently lost. Launching at *your own* worktree (the one this session created) is fine, and is the right call when you need to test plugin code that only exists on this branch — just commit frequently so an unexpected exit doesn't drop work.

```bash
# SAFE — root repo, never auto-cleaned:
/Applications/Godot_mono.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --editor --path ~/godot-ai/test_project/

# SAFE — this session's own worktree (commit frequently):
/Applications/Godot_mono.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --editor --path .claude/worktrees/<this-session>/test_project/

# DANGEROUS — another session's worktree, can vanish out from under you:
/Applications/Godot_mono.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --editor --path .claude/worktrees/some-other-name/test_project/
```

When in doubt, prefer the root repo's `test_project/` — it's never auto-cleaned and matches what most CI smoke flows assume. For auto-cleaned assistant worktrees, this is the safe default unless you intentionally need the current worktree's live plugin code and are committing frequently.

### Live-smoke scene hygiene

Write tools that mutate the scene (`script_attach`, `node_create`, `node_set_property`, etc.) dirty the scene in memory but don't touch disk. `project_run` with any mode internally calls `try_autosave()` → `_save_scene_with_preview()`, which **persists those in-memory mutations to the scene file on disk**. A common trap during live smoke tests: attach a throwaway script to `/Main`, run the scene to exercise `_ready()`, and discover the attachment is now committed to `test_project/main.tscn`.

Three safe patterns:
- **`project_run(autosave=False, …)`** suppresses Godot's save-before-running for the play call, so MCP scene mutations stay in memory and the `.tscn` on disk is untouched. Preferred for smoke tests; default stays `True` so existing callers see no behavior change.
- **Attach to a throwaway scene** dedicated to smoke work, not to `main.tscn` or any scene a test suite depends on.
- **Plan to revert**: after smoking, `git status` in the worktree and `git checkout -- test_project/<scene>` to undo any autosaved pollution. Verify before staging.

Also note: `script_create` and `filesystem_write_text` are **not undoable** — they write `.gd`/`.uid`/other files directly to disk and response bodies carry `"undoable": false` with a reason. Smoke artifacts need explicit cleanup (`rm` the file pair, or `git clean -n` first to preview).

## Dev workflow

```bash
cd ~/godot-ai
script/setup-dev             # creates .venv, installs deps, applies macOS .pth fix
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest -v                    # run tests
```

`uv.lock` is intentionally untracked: dependencies resolve from `pyproject.toml`, and CI installs with pip (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`) rather than enforcing a uv lockfile.

**macOS + Python 3.13 note**: Files inside `.venv` inherit the macOS hidden flag (dot-prefix directory). Python 3.13 skips hidden `.pth` files (CPython gh-113659), breaking editable installs. `script/setup-dev` generates a `sitecustomize.py` in the venv that adds `src/` to `sys.path` via normal import (unaffected by hidden flags). No manual `chflags` needed.

**Windows note**: use `.\script\setup-dev.ps1` instead of `script/setup-dev`. The Windows script creates `test_project\addons\godot_ai` as a directory junction — no admin rights and no Windows Developer Mode required. If you ever need to recreate the link by hand (e.g. outside setup-dev), either form works:

```powershell
# from repo root or worktree root
Remove-Item -LiteralPath test_project\addons\godot_ai -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path test_project\addons\godot_ai -Target ..\..\plugin\addons\godot_ai
```

Or in cmd: `mklink /J test_project\addons\godot_ai ..\..\plugin\addons\godot_ai`.

**When troubleshooting any dev-environment / setup / dependency / symlink issue, scan `script/` first** for an existing fixer before doing it by hand. The project ships scripts for a reason — bypassing them re-introduces the bugs they were written to handle.

- Using the one-shot CLI from an external Agent to inspect or mutate a Godot project: [docs/agent-cli-workflow.md](docs/agent-cli-workflow.md).
- Server start/adopt/teardown, discovery tiers, `editor_reload_plugin`: [docs/server-lifecycle.md](docs/server-lifecycle.md)
- Cutting a release, and the self-update install path: [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md).
  **Any change touching `mcp_dock.gd` update paths, `update_reload_runner.gd`, plugin
  disable/enable, `prepare_for_update_reload()`, or the release ZIP layout must run
  `script/local-self-update-smoke`.**

## Testing

### Python tests
```bash
pytest -v                    # ~1300 unit + integration tests
```

### Godot-side tests
GDScript test suites in `test_project/tests/` exercise handlers inside the running editor. Run via MCP:
```
test_run                     # compact: summary + failures only
test_run suite=scene         # run one suite
test_run verbose=true        # include every individual test result
test_manage op=results_get   # review last results (resource form: godot://test/results)
```

Test suites extend `McpTestSuite`; drop `test_*.gd` files in `res://tests/` and they're auto-discovered. Authoring guide + full assertion/lifecycle API reference: [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md).

### Stress / load testing

`script/stormtest.py` fires concurrent randomized tool calls with reload churn at a live
editor. Run it after changes to the dispatcher, transport, readiness gating, session
routing, or the reload/handoff path: [docs/STRESS_TESTING.md](docs/STRESS_TESTING.md).

### Test hygiene checklist — common silent-failure patterns to avoid

A test that passes for the wrong reason is worse than a missing test: it ships a regression under a green check. Watch for these masking patterns when writing or reviewing tests:

- **Bare `return` in a test body**. Every `return` in a `test_*` function must be preceded by either an `assert_*` call (for a real failure) or `skip("reason")` (for an environment precondition that can't be met). A silent `return` passes with zero assertions — the runner guardrail catches this now, but the failure message ("0 assertions") is noisier than a targeted `skip()` that reports *why* the test couldn't run.
- **Counts instead of stored Variants**. Asserting `track_count == 1` or `child_count > 0` says nothing about the stored value. For mutation tools that take JSON dicts (Color, Vector2, Vector3, keyframe values), read back via `track_get_key_value`, `mi.mesh`, `mat.gravity`, etc. and assert `value is Color` / `value is Vector3`. See "Value coercion" in [docs/plugin-architecture.md](docs/plugin-architecture.md#undo-contract).
- **Bare `get_theme_*` getters in override tests**. Reading a theme value via `get_theme_color(...)` alone falls back through the theme chain — a broken `add_theme_color_override` will silently resolve to the default, passing the assertion. Godot 4.6 removed the `get_theme_*_override` getters, so the honest pattern is now: assert `has_theme_color_override(...)` (or the constant/font-size/stylebox variant) FIRST, then read the value with the regular getter — the override presence check is what prevents the fallback from masking a bug. `test_ui.gd::test_build_layout_theme_override_*` are the reference pattern.
- **`assert_has_key` without a follow-up value check**. Presence of `"data"` in a response says nothing about correctness. Every `assert_has_key(result, "data")` should be paired with at least one `assert_eq` / `assert_true` on a field inside `result.data`.
- **`editor_undo()` / `editor_redo()` without checking the return**. The helper returns `bool` — `false` means the undo silently no-oped. For tests that assert post-undo state, capture `var did_undo := editor_undo(_undo_redo); assert_true(did_undo, "undo should succeed")` before asserting the rolled-back value.
- **Bare `except: pass` in Python tests**. Swallowing exceptions can let a half-failed operation still pass the downstream assertion. Catch specific exceptions, and if you truly want to ignore a cleanup failure, log it.
- **CI scripts that drop `failures[]`**. When a `script/ci-*` parses a `test_run` response, it must iterate `content.get("failures", [])` and print `{suite}.{test}: {message}` on failure — not just the passed/failed counts. The reference pattern is in `script/ci-godot-tests:117-119`.
- **Version-gated skips**. For a test that depends on future newer-engine behavior, call `if skip_on_godot_lt("4.6", "reason"): return` at the top (`McpTestSuite.skip_on_godot_lt` returns `bool`). CI runs a Godot 4.5 Linux canary (`Godot tests / Linux (Godot 4.5)`, pinned to `4.5.0`) in addition to the three 4.7.0 OS rows so the documented floor catches parse-cascade regressions. `ci-check-gdscript` is strict on every supported version; Logger-backed scripts are parsed normally now.

## Before you commit

**Always run the full gauntlet before every commit** — `ruff check`, `pytest -v`,
then `test_run` against a live Godot editor, plus a live smoke of anything you
changed. Python mocks do not catch GDScript bugs, editor API regressions, or
undo/redo breakage. Steps: [docs/verification.md](docs/verification.md).

## Tool inventory sources

Do not maintain a full tool inventory in this guide. The active inventory has canonical sources:

- `src/godot_ai/tools/domains.py` defines the domain metadata used by Python registration.
- `plugin/addons/godot_ai/tool_catalog.gd` mirrors the registered tool surface for the Godot dock.
- `tests/unit/test_tool_domains.py` verifies the GDScript catalog stays in sync with the Python registrations and prints a paste-over-ready diff when it drifts.
- `docs/TOOLS.md` is the human-facing reference for the full current tool/resource list and op map.

Use those sources when you need the current inventory. Keep this guide focused on the rules for changing the tool surface so it does not become another stale hand-maintained list.

Why the surface is shaped this way, how plugin command names differ from MCP tool names,
and the checklist for adding a tool: [docs/tool-surface.md](docs/tool-surface.md).

## Python conventions

- Handlers: `return await runtime.send_command("command_name", params)` — don't handle errors.
- Write handlers: `await require_writable_async(runtime)` before sending commands (from `handlers/_readiness.py`).
- Tools create `DirectRuntime.from_context(ctx)` and delegate to handlers.

## Game-side code: gate on `Engine.is_editor_hint()`, not `OS.has_feature("editor")`

Code shipped as an autoload (e.g. `plugin/addons/godot_ai/runtime/game_helper.gd`) that's intended to run only in the game subprocess must guard on `Engine.is_editor_hint()`. `OS.has_feature("editor")` is a compile-time `TOOLS_ENABLED` check — it returns true in the game subprocess too, because play-in-editor spawns the game with the same editor binary. `is_editor_hint()` is the runtime-context check.

Corollary for the plugin side: when registering a game-side autoload via `add_autoload_singleton`, also call `ProjectSettings.save()` explicitly. `EditorPlugin.add_autoload_singleton` only mutates in-memory settings — the subprocess reads project.godot from disk, so without an explicit save the autoload is missing in the child process. See `plugin.gd::_ensure_game_helper_autoload`.

## Write tools must be undoable

Every tool that mutates the scene (create, delete, reparent, set_property, etc.) must use `EditorUndoRedoManager`. No exceptions. The pattern:

```gdscript
_undo_redo.create_action("MCP: <description>")
_undo_redo.add_do_method(...)
_undo_redo.add_undo_method(...)
_undo_redo.add_do_reference(node)  # prevent GC of created nodes
_undo_redo.commit_action()
```

Response must include `"undoable": true`. If an operation genuinely can't be undone (file writes, scene open/close), include `"undoable": false` with a reason.

Four patterns this rule implies — bundling auto-created dependencies into the same undo
action, coercing JSON values to typed Variants, resolving auto-generated indices at undo
time rather than do time, and `GEN_EDIT_STATE_INSTANCE` for scene instancing — are worked
through in [docs/plugin-architecture.md](docs/plugin-architecture.md#undo-contract).

### Additional GDScript conventions

- Handlers are `@tool` `RefCounted` scripts with **no** `class_name`. `plugin.gd` registers them by script path (`McpDispatcher.register_lazy_handler` / `register_lazy`) and the dispatcher `load()`s them at first dispatch (#736) — do not add a `const X := preload(...)` for a handler back into `plugin.gd`; that re-inflates the boot-time compile closure. Cross-handler and values/presets deps inside `handlers/` still use `const X := preload(...)` from their consumers. The `Mcp*`-prefixed `class_name` is reserved for utility classes shared across the project (e.g. `McpScenePath`, `McpPropertyErrors`, `McpParamValidators`); see #253 for why bare `class_name`s on handlers are forbidden.
- Return `{"data": {...}}` on success, `McpErrorCodes.make(code, msg)` on failure — include the failing parameter value and use `error_string(err)` for Godot error codes.
- The dispatcher detects empty/null handler results and reports `INTERNAL_ERROR` — a handler crash no longer looks like success.
- Use `##` for doc comments, typed arrays (`Array[String]`), never Python-style `"""`.

## Test coverage

100% code coverage for core features, always. Every tool, handler, and protocol path must have both:
- **Python tests** (`tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`): protocol, WebSocket, client logic
- **Godot-side tests** (`test_project/tests/`): handlers exercised against the live editor


## Audit follow-up work

A whole-codebase audit's Tier-1 cleanup merged as PR #684. The remaining work — issues #685–#691 plus a 115-item backlog — is tracked in [docs/audit-tier2-plan.md](docs/audit-tier2-plan.md). When picking up any of it, follow that file's workflow: one PR per theme, the full test gauntlet before every commit, verify each finding against current code before touching anything, and ask the maintainer before the flagged design decisions.

## Godot version support (4.5+)

The plugin supports **Godot 4.5+** (4.7+ recommended). 4.5 is exercised by a CI canary (`Godot tests / Linux (Godot 4.5)` in `ci.yml`, pinned to `4.5.0`) so the parse-cascade class of regression cannot recur unnoticed at the documented floor.

- **Forward-compat engine APIs go through `Engine.call(...)` / `OS.call(...)` when they are newer than the supported floor.** A direct call to a method that only exists in a newer Godot is type-checked by the older engine's GDScript parser against the native class and rejected at parse time, even when guarded by `has_method(...)` at runtime. That parse failure can cascade through preloads and brick the whole plugin. This was the #476 regression for `Engine.capture_script_backtraces()` on 4.3. The current floor makes that specific call safe, but the pattern still applies to future 4.6+ APIs until the floor moves again.
- **CI GDScript validation**: `script/ci-check-gdscript` runs before Godot tests in CI. It scans the `--import` log for `SCRIPT ERROR` / `Parse Error` lines and fails the build early if any GDScript has syntax errors, before the test runner even starts. Strict on every supported Godot version, including the 4.5 canary.
- **CI Linux runner**: Linux Godot CI uses `chickensoft-games/setup-godot@v2` on `ubuntu-latest` (not a Docker image). All three OS jobs (Linux, macOS, Windows) use the same chickensoft action for consistent Godot setup, pinned to `4.7.0`. A fourth `godot-tests` row runs the Linux 4.5 canary on `4.5.0` (the action wants 3-part semver — `4.5` / `4.5.stable` are rejected). Step timeouts are set on test and smoke steps to prevent CI hangs.
- **Version-gated tests are for future floor bumps only.** Keep `McpTestSuite.skip_on_godot_lt(...)` available, but do not skip current-floor behavior; the 4.5 canary should exercise it.

## What NOT to do

- Don't call `EditorInterface` methods from WebSocket callbacks — always queue
- Don't cache `get_edited_scene_root()` across frames — it changes on scene switch
- Don't add error handling in individual tools — `GodotClient.send()` raises on errors
- Don't forget the `overwrite` parameter on `animation_create` / `animation_create_simple` — without it, creating an animation with the same name errors instead of replacing
